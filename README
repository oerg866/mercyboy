Hello!

This is 'mercyboy', a Nintendo Gameboy emulator I've started as a little side
project to mess with emulation, refresh plain C knowledge and tinker around
with SDL.

The purpose of this is to be simple and small, I'll probably make it run on
DOS at some point in time.

The license of choice is CC-BY-NC.

This can be built using several different facilities (make, QMake, platform-
specific toolchains...), check out docs/BUILDING.md!

Have fun!
